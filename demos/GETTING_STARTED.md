# Demo Quick Start Guide

## 🎯 What are these demos?

These are **10 comprehensive, production-ready demo applications** that showcase every feature of the Redis Wrapper library. Each demo is a complete, runnable example that you can learn from and adapt for your own projects.

## 🚀 Run Your First Demo

```bash
# Make sure Redis is running
redis-server

# Run the getting started demo
bun run demos/01-getting-started.ts
```

That's it! The demo will show you basic Redis operations in action.

## 💡 Quick Tips

### Running Multiple Demos
```bash
# Run demos in sequence
for demo in demos/0{1..5}*.ts; do bun run "$demo"; done
```

### Using Different Redis Instances
```bash
# Use custom Redis URL
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6380 bun run demos/01-getting-started.ts
```

### Reading the Code
Each demo follows the same structure:
1. **Types** - Data structures used
2. **Classes** - Reusable business logic
3. **Demo** - Actual examples with output
4. **Best Practices** - What you should remember

## 🎓 Learning Strategy

### Day 1: Foundations (1 hour)
- Run demos 01, 11, 02
- Read the code comments
- Experiment with changing values
- Understand CRUD operations

### Day 2: Advanced Features (1 hour)
- Run demos 04, 05, 06, 07
- Understand different data types
- Try modifying examples

### Day 3: Production Patterns (1 hour)
- Run demos 08, 09, 10
- Study the architecture
- Plan your own implementation

## 🛠️ Customizing Demos

All demos are self-contained and easy to modify:

```typescript
// In any demo file, change these to experiment:

// Change the data
const users = ["alice", "bob", "charlie"]; // Add your names!

// Change the timing
await Bun.sleep(1000); // Make it slower to see what happens

// Change the limits
const maxUsers = 100; // Set your own quotas

// Add logging
console.log("Debug:", someVariable); // See what's happening
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Connection refused"
```bash
# Redis isn't running. Start it:
redis-server

# Or with Docker:
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:latest
```

### "Module not found"
```bash
# Install dependencies:
bun install
```

### "Permission denied"
```bash
# Make files executable:
chmod +x demos/*.ts
```

## 📖 Next Steps

After running the demos:

1. **Read the full [API Documentation](../API.md)**
2. **Check out [REDIS_FEATURES.md](../REDIS_FEATURES.md)** for Redis coverage
3. **Look at [index.test.ts](../index.test.ts)** for test examples
4. **Start building your own application!**
