## 💡 Common Patterns

### Pattern: Namespace Isolation

Used in: 02, 03, 04, 06, 09

```typescript
const app1 = createNamespacedRedis(redis, "app1");
const app2 = createNamespacedRedis(redis, "app2");

// Keys are isolated
await app1.set("key", "value1"); // Stored as "app1:key"
await app2.set("key", "value2"); // Stored as "app2:key"
```

### Pattern: Sorted Sets for Rankings

Used in: 04, 05, 10

```typescript
// Add with scores
await redis.zadd("leaderboard", [100, "player1"], [200, "player2"]);

// Get top 10
await redis.zrevrange("leaderboard", 0, 9, true);
```

### Pattern: Streams for Events

Used in: 06

```typescript
// Add event
const id = await redis.xadd("events", "*", {
  type: "user_login",
  userId: "123",
  timestamp: Date.now().toString()
});

// Read events
const events = await redis.xrange("events", "-", "+");
```

### Pattern: HyperLogLog for Counting

Used in: 08

```typescript
// Track unique visitors
await redis.pfadd("visitors:today", "user1", "user2", "user3");

// Get count
const count = await redis.pfcount("visitors:today");
```

## 🔧 Tips & Best Practices

### Performance
- Use pipelining for bulk operations
- Set appropriate TTLs to prevent memory bloat
- Use SCAN instead of KEYS in production
- Consider Redis persistence settings

### Security
- Use namespaces to isolate tenants
- Validate input before storing
- Sanitize user-provided keys
- Use Redis AUTH in production

### Scalability
- Use connection pooling
- Implement proper error handling
- Monitor memory usage
- Consider Redis Cluster for large datasets

### Reliability
- Implement retry logic
- Use Redis persistence (RDB/AOF)
- Set up Redis Sentinel for HA
- Monitor connection health

---

## 🧪 Testing

All demos are self-contained and cleanup after themselves. They're safe to run repeatedly.

```bash
# Run all demos
for demo in demos/*.ts; do
  echo "Running $demo..."
  bun run "$demo"
done
```
